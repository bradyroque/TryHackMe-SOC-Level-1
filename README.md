As an aspiring SOC analyst, I eagerly embarked on TryHackMe's specialized training for the role. The course offered a comprehensive overview of various industry tools and frameworks, providing me with hands-on experience with many tools previously unfamiliar to me. While using SIEMs, Wireshark, and Snort was both enjoyable and anticipated, I also encountered numerous opportunities to explore new tools such as Autopsy, Zeek, and OSquery, expanding my skill set significantly.
